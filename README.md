This is me playing around and learning Godot.

Following the
[How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0)
tutorial by Brackey's. Its been a lot of fun.

This repo makes use of https://godot-rust.github.io/ instead of GDScript. I
will be putting my leanings here and leaving notes in the comments for me to
come back to.


License for my code is MIT. For the assets they can be downloaded
[here](https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle) and are under
CC0. Markdown for both are included in this repository.
